**Tumor Detection Using Brain MRI Images**

This repository contains a Python-based implementation for detecting brain tumors using MRI images. The project leverages datasets and visualizations to analyze and predict the presence of tumors effectively.

_Features_
- Data Source: Utilizes the Kaggle dataset "Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection".
- Visualization: Includes customized plotting for result analysis using Matplotlib.
- Machine Learning: Implements models for tumor classification (if applicable).

_Prerequisites_
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, any other libraries used in the script

To install the required packages, run: pip install -r requirements.txt

_Usage_
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tumor-detection.git
   
   cd tumor-detection
3. Download the Kaggle dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
4. Run the script: python tumor_detection.py
5. Follow the instructions in the terminal or Jupyter Notebook to train models or visualize results.

_File Structure_
- tumor_detection.py: The main script for tumor detection.
- data/: Directory to store the MRI dataset (not included in this repository).
- results/: Directory for storing output plots and analysis.
